For version 0.2.0

Allow the creation of anchors to connect two objects together
    - Anchor will make it so that the two objects will no longer collide
    - This will require a sort of blacklist to prevent two objects from colliding

Allow the creation of bearings where two objects are connected but are free to rotate
    - Constrained in terms of linear motion
    - Unconstrained in terms of angular motion
    - This should make a double pendulum

Double pendulum?
